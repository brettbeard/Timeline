### Overview

With this WPF control you can create interactive timelines. The control is inspired by Simile Timeline Control (which is implemented with ajax). It is completely based on templates and styles, so it is possible to provide different style for events and timeline itself.

The control is developed under very friendly BSD license. If you do not know what this means, it's that the library or source code can be used, reused and sold as part of your commercial project without need to change your code license or pay for the control.
